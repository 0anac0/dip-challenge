# Go Case - Digital Image Processing Challenge

For the code challenge I decided on making a simple, yet efficient, GUI, so that the input could be easily acquired. 

## how to use the application
![Examples](/GUI.png)

While running the application, the user should see a GUI like the one above. Then, when clicking on 'Escolha a imagem> procure o arquivo', a file picker should open itself, and the user will choose a mockup image to test.
After that, upon clicking on the next button, the user should choose also the font file (in ttf) with another file picker.
Then, the first text box should be filled with the name one might want to see in their mockup, the second one with the x position, and the third with the y position. The last text box, then, refers to the font size.
Then, when the button 'salvar' is clicked, the application opens a mockup image like the one bellow, and the image saves itself on the application's root file.
